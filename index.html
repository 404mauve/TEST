    <pre style="text-align: center;font-size: 20px;">Don't apologize for what you did, I can't look past it
Now you're trying to start an argument, you're so dramatic
But I keep on coming back again, feel just like an addict
And I know I say this often, but this time I swear I've had it</pre>
    <br>
    <pre style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">Leave me be swear it's alright
I'm getting tired baby, lead me straight into the light
See you conspire all the lies you keep on telling me
I can see right through you
Never thought that you would change, but I can't recognize the new you</pre>

    <pre style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah</pre>
    <pre style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">So when things don't go as planned, can you tell me in advance?
You leave me out in the dark and then tell me to relax
Your words mean more than a chance
And I can't stop myself from thinking 'bout the things that we had
Patience is all that I ask</pre>
